Here is an example test environment for a working OpenStack-Ansible (OSA) deployment with a small number of servers.

This example environment has the following characteristics:

- One infrastructure node for the **control plane** host (32 vCPU, 128 GB RAM, 2 TB RAID1 HDD)
- One compute host (32 vCPU, 128 GB RAM, 2 TB RAID1 HDD)
- One Storage node (2 vCPU,  GB RAM, 2 TB RAID1 HDD). A basic compute kit environment, with the Image (glance) and Compute (nova) services set to use file-backed storage.
- Two Network Interface Card (NIC) for each host on a bond setup as `bond0`
- Internet access via the router address `192.168.10.1` on the Management Network

The following figure depicts this test environment and its components.

## Network Configuration

### Switch Port Configuration

!!! Note
    The following example provides a good reference for switch configuration and cabinet layout. This example may be more than what is required for basic setups however it can be adjusted to just about any configuration. Additionally you will need to adjust the VLANS noted within this example to match your environment.

## Network CIDR/VLAN assignments

!!! note
    The VLAN IDs shown in the above figure  are  for the purpose of example only. You should change them to represent your requirements. 

The following CIDR and VLAN assignments are used for this environment.
